Andrea Triossi obtained his Master’s degree in Physics at the University of Padua and his PhD in Computer Science at the Ca’Foscari University of Venice working on the investigation of new methodologies allowing the hardware synthesis starting from high level languages. He was a Fellow at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, where he worked in the CMS collaboration. He was in charge of the design and commissioning of several electronic boards for the upgrade of the Drift Tube sub-detector. He also worked at CIEMAT (the spanish Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas), INFN (the italian Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare) and CNRS (the french Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) on the readout and trigger system of several particle and nuclear experiments like AGATA, JUNO, NEDA and WArP. Since 2021 he has been assistant professor at the University of Padua.
