bio: PhD at Univeristy of Padova, then research fellow at CERN and
research associate at MIT. Since 2002 member of the CMS collaboration,
spanning detector construction and commissioning, trigger and
computing development and operations, Higgs
discovery, searches for Dark Matter and New Physics. 
Now focused on advanced technologies and statistical methods 
to reduce bias in the analysis of complex datasets, in particular
the developmet of a triggerless readout for HEP detectors and
Machine Learning based anomaly detection algorithms

Marco Zanetti is an associate professor at the Department of Physics
and Astronomy at the University of Padova. He conceived and now
coordinate the master program in Physics of Data.
A member of the CMS experiment at CERN, he participated in the
discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. Since then he is looking for 
Physics not explained by the Standard Model, developing technical and
statistical tools allowing to reduce the bias with which novel
phenomena are looked for.
