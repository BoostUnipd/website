summary: The second workshop of Physics of Data on the Physics of Machine Learning.
abstract: 'Statistical Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning is deeply transforming our society and having a relevant impact in several fields including: 1) in the sciences there is growing interest in the predictive ability of models based on the analysis of big data; 2) In the economic sphere, digital transformation (i.e. the process of integrating digital technologies into all aspects of business), is leading to substantial changes at the level of technology and value generation; 3) in social life also promoting customs, habits, and behavioral patterns.
A big issue is that today some of the most accurate models in the Machine Learning world are what we call a ‘black box’ model as they lack explicability and interpretability. As Physicists, this is one of the most exciting challenges and that is why we will devote the second Physics of Data Workshop on this topic, inviting world class experts and young researchers in this field,  providing an overview of the possible open problems and research paths in this field.
Food and accommodation in Asiago will be covered thanks to the UNIPD grant in teaching innovation. Limited number of places available, preferences will be given to first year Physics of Data students. A bus leaving from Padova to Asiago will be organized  and freely available to students and speakers.'
