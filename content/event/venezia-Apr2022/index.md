title: Spring Workshop on Physics of Data

event: First Physics of Data workshop
event_url: https://www.aisociety-unipd.it/workshop-physics-of-machine-learning-for-physics-of-data/

location: Palazzo Franchetti, Venice
address:
  street: S. Marco, 2847
  city: Venezia
  region: Veneto
  country: Italy

summary: The first workshop of Physics of Data with keynote speakers and alumni.
abstract: 'The modeling and the theoretical interpretation of complex natural phenomena from large amounts of data are at the core of the research in Physics. The Big Data revolution presents in this sense the challenges and opportunities for the physicists of today. In addition to the figure of Data Scientist, specialized purely in the analysis of large amounts of data, it is increasingly clear the need to also train figures able to develop the methods and modelling to better understand processes and causal relationships behind the data. This workshop will  provide an overview of the possible open problems and research paths in several  that physicists of Data can tackle thanks to their training. Topics in Fundamental Physics, Astrophysics, Physics of Complex Systems and Machine Learning will be presented through international researchers and young scholars, as well as alumni of the Physics of Data Master.
Food and accommodation in Venice will be covered thanks to the UNIPD grant in teaching innovation. Limited number of places available, preferences will be given based on the studentâ€™s career and full attendance of the workshop..'
